\section{Hardware Design}
In comparison to other Micromouse projects, we laid the focus not so much on
the educational aspect for low-level programming, but on the possiblity to try
out more sophisticated methods of mobile robotics.

\subsection{Microcontroller}
Our design uses the Espressif ESP32-S2-WROOM microcontroller module
featuring an ARM processor clocked at \SI{240}{\mega\hertz},
\SI{320}{\kilo\byte} of SRAM, \SI{4}{\mega\byte} of flash and Wi-Fi
connectivity \cite{esp32-s2-wroom-datasheet}.

Espressif provides a software framework that implements a Wi-Fi stack and a
convenient interface to the controller's peripherals for the C language.

\subsection{Inertial Measurement Unit}
Our board has a slot for a board containing an Inertial Measurement Unit, an
ICM-20948 Module by Adafruit with the TDK\,InvenSense ICM-20948 chip that
contains a MEMS accelerometer, a gyroscope and a compass with three axes each
\cite{icm20948-datasheet}.

The module is connected to the microcontroller through a SPI bus.
