	abstract = {In this article we describe the design of a modular, low cost, biomimetic robot created to mimic the size and locomotion of a common rat (rattus norvegicus). The created robot is untethered, easy to use and simple to produce; it thus can be used as a universal research platform. It is based on tendondriven actuation, which allows for a compliant leg design and enables generation of open-loop controlled, simple locomotion patterns: trotting forward, backward as well as turning left and right. Small biomimetic robots can be useful for behavioral studies in combination with animals or for new, efﬁcient types of locomotion, transportation and exploration systems. They are however challenging to build as mobile robots, since their size limits the use of common-sized actuators, as well as the use of large, long lasting power supplies.},

In accordance with the rules of human reaching movement, the intrinsic tau jerk guidance strategy ensures continuity of the acceleration; further, it also ensures that its value is zero at the start and end of the movement. The approach has been implemented on a three-degrees-of-freedom 3R planar manipulator. The results show that, within a defined time, both the position gap and attitude gap can be reposefully closed, and the curves of joint velocity, acceleration, and driving torque are continuous and smooth. According to the dynamic analysis, the proposed approach tends to consume less energy. The bio-inspired method has the potential to be applied in particular scenarios in the future, such as a mobile robot with a manipulator exploring an unknown environment.},

	shorttitle = {{TossingBot}},
	abstract = {We investigate whether a robot arm can learn to pick and throw arbitrary objects into selected boxes quickly and accurately. Throwing has the potential to increase the physical reachability and picking speed of a robot arm. However, precisely throwing arbitrary objects in unstructured settings presents many challenges: from acquiring reliable pre-throw conditions (e.g. initial pose of object in manipulator) to handling varying object-centric properties (e.g. mass distribution, friction, shape) and dynamics (e.g. aerodynamics). In this work, we propose an end-to-end formulation that jointly learns to infer control parameters for grasping and throwing motion primitives from visual observations (images of arbitrary objects in a bin) through trial and error. Within this formulation, we investigate the synergies between grasping and throwing (i.e., learning grasps that enable more accurate throws) and between simulation and deep learning (i.e., using deep networks to predict residuals on top of control parameters predicted by a physics simulator). The resulting system, {TossingBot}, is able to grasp and throw arbitrary objects into boxes located outside its maximum reach range at 500+ mean picks per hour (600+ grasps per hour with 85\% throwing accuracy); and generalizes to new objects and target locations.

We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical Traveling Salesman Problem ({TSP}), and report simulation results. We also discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using {TSP}. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the Ant System ({AS}) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics –global data structure revision, distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the {AS}.},

The first step towards this goal is to accommodate, under practical constraints, various design objectives that are desirable in both time and frequency-domains. Such performance-prioritised unification is aimed to relieve practising engineers from having to select a particular control scheme and from sacrificing certain performance goals resulting from pre-committing to the adopted scheme.  With the recent progress in evolutionary computing based extra-numeric, multi-criterion search and optimisation techniques, such unification of {LTI} control schemes becomes feasible, analytically and practically, and the resultant designs can be creative.  The techniques developed are applied to, and illustrated by, three design problems.  The unified approach automatically provides an integrator for zero-steady state error in velocity control of a {DC} motor, meets multiple objectives in designing an {LTI} controller for a non-minimum phase plant and offers a high-performing {LTI} controller network for a nonlinear chemical process.},

To determine whether local learning rules are su cient for learning, we encode the network architectures and learning dynamics genetically and then apply selection pressure to evolve networks capable of learning the four boolean functions of one variable. The successful networks are analysed and we show how learning behaviour emerges as a distributed property of the entire network. Finally the utility of genetic algorithms as a tool of discovery is discussed.},

	abstract = {Inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) are increasingly utilized as motion capture devices in human movement studies. Given their high portability, {IMUs} can be deployed in any environment, importantly those outside of the laboratory. However, a signiﬁcant challenge limits the adoption of this technology; namely estimating the orientation of the {IMUs} to a common world frame, which is essential to estimating the rotations across skeletal joints. Common (probabilistic) methods for estimating {IMU} orientation rely on the ability to update the current orientation estimate using data provided by the {IMU}. The objective of this work is to present a novel error-state Kalman ﬁlter that yields highly accurate estimates of {IMU} orientation that are robust to poor measurement updates from ﬂuctuations in the local magnetic ﬁeld and/or highly dynamic movements. The method is validated with ground truth data collected with highly accurate orientation measurements provided by a coordinate measurement machine. As an example, the method yields {IMUestimated} orientations that remain within 3.7 degrees ({RMS} error) over relatively long (25 cumulative minutes) trials even in the presence of large ﬂuctuations in the local magnetic ﬁeld. For comparison, ignoring the magnetic interference increases the {RMS} error to 12.8 degrees, more than a threefold increase.},

In order to leverage their ability to learn complex functions, large amounts of data are required for training. Training a large convolutional network to produce state-of-the-art results can take weeks, even when using modern {GPUs}. Producing labels using a trained network can also be costly when dealing with web-scale datasets. In this work, we present a simple algorithm which accelerates training and inference by a signiﬁcant factor, and can yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. This is done by computing convolutions as pointwise products in the Fourier domain while reusing the same transformed feature map many times. The algorithm is implemented on a {GPU} architecture and addresses a number of related challenges.},

Each component is expressed by a smoothness prior model which is expressed by a stochastic linear differenceequation. The essential differencefrom the previous methods is the use of non-Gaussian distributions. Namely, the white noise input to each component and the observational noise are not necessarily Gaussian. This allows for the possible existence of jump of the trend or seasonal component and of the outliers. Thus by the use of this non-Gaussian state space model, seasonal time series with possible existence of outliers and sudden structural changes can be automatically handled without any special treatment. The filtering and smoothing formulas for the non-Gaussian state space model is realized by using Gaussian mixture approximation to the involved densities. Numerical examples are shown to contrast with Gaussian modeling.},

One obstacle to overcome is the amount of data needed by learning systems of this type. In this article, we propose to address this issue through a divide-and-conquer approach. We argue that complex decision problems can be naturally decomposed into multiple tasks that unfold in sequence or in parallel. By associating each task with a reward function, this problem decomposition can be seamlessly accommodated within the standard reinforcement-learning formalism. The specific way we do so is through a generalization of two fundamental operations in reinforcement learning: policy improvement and policy evaluation. The generalized version of these operations allow one to leverage the solution of some tasks to speed up the solution of others. If the reward function of a task can be well approximated as a linear combination of the reward functions of tasks previously solved, we can reduce a reinforcement-learning problem to a simpler linear regression. When this is not the case, the agent can still exploit the task solutions by using them to interact with and learn about the environment. Both strategies considerably reduce the amount of data needed to solve a reinforcement-learning problem.},

As a result, we find that the algorithm outperforms standard particle filtering and other nonlinear filtering methods very substantially.

	abstract = {The Fourier domain is used in computer vision and machine learning as image analysis tasks in the Fourier domain are analogous to spatial domain methods but are achieved using different operations. Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) use machine learning to achieve state-of-the-art results with respect to many computer vision tasks. One of the main limiting aspects of {CNNs} is the computational cost of updating a large number of convolution parameters. Further, in the spatial domain, larger images take exponentially longer than smaller image to train on {CNNs} due to the operations involved in convolution methods. Consequently, {CNNs} are often not a viable solution for large image computer vision tasks. In this paper a Fourier Convolution Neural Network ({FCNN}) is proposed whereby training is conducted entirely within the Fourier domain. The advantage offered is that there is a signiﬁcant speed up in training time without loss of effectiveness. Using the proposed approach larger images can therefore be processed within viable computation time. The {FCNN} is fully described and evaluated. The evaluation was conducted using the benchmark Cifar10 and {MNIST} datasets, and a bespoke fundus retina image dataset. The results demonstrate that convolution in the Fourier domain gives a signiﬁcant speed up without adversely affecting accuracy. For simplicity the proposed {FCNN} concept is presented in the context of a basic {CNN} architecture, however, the {FCNN} concept has the potential to improve the speed of any neural network system involving convolution.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with {MDD}. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS} This randomized, waiting list–controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an {MDD} diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). {INTERVENTIONS} Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 {mL} of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the {GRID}-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ({GRID}-{HAMD}) scores at baseline (score of Ն17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated ({QIDS}-{SR}).
{RESULTS} Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89\%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean ({SD}) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67\%), and had a mean ({SD}) baseline {GRID}-{HAMD} score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean ({SD}) {GRID}-{HAMD} scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.2; 95\% {CI}, 1.4-3.0; P {\textless} .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95\% {CI}, 1.7-3.6; P {\textless} .001). The {QIDS}-{SR} documented a rapid decrease in mean ({SD}) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 3.0; 95\% {CI}, 1.9-4.0; P {\textless} .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 3.1; 95\% {CI}, 1.9-4.2; P {\textless} .001). In the overall sample, 16 participants (67\%) at week 1 and 17 (71\%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (Ն50\% reduction in {GRID}-{HAMD} score), and 14 participants (58\%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54\%) at week 4 were in remission (Յ7 {GRID}-{HAMD} score).
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating {MDD}, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatmentresistant depression. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION} {ClinicalTrials}.gov Identifier: {NCT}03181529 {JAMA} Psychiatry. doi:10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3285 Published online November 4, 2020.},

	abstract = {Background/aim: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-{MeO}-{DMT}) is a psychoactive compound found in several plants and in high concentrations in Bufo alvarius toad venom. Synthetic, toad, and plant-sourced 5-{MeO}-{DMT} are used for spiritual and recreational purposes and may have psychotherapeutic effects. However, the use of 5-{MeO}-{DMT} is not well understood. Therefore, we examined patterns of use, motivations for consumption, subjective effects, and potential benefits and consequences associated with 5-{MeO}-{DMT} use.
Methods: Using internet-based advertisements, 515 respondents (Mage=35.4. {SD}=11.7; male=79\%; White/Caucasian=86\%; United States resident=42\%) completed a web-based survey.
Results: Most respondents consumed 5-{MeO}-{DMT} infrequently ({\textless}once/year), for spiritual exploration, and had used less than four times in their lifetime. The majority (average of 90\%) reported moderate-to-strong mystical-type experiences (Mintensity=3.64, {SD}=1.11; range 0–5; e.g., ineffability, timelessness, awe/amazement, experience of pure being/awareness), and relatively fewer (average of 37\%) experienced very slight challenging experiences (Mintensity=0.95, {SD}=0.91; range 0–5; e.g., anxiousness, fear). Less than half (39\%) reported repeated consumption during the same session, and very few reported drug craving/desire (8\%), or legal (1\%), medical (1\%), or psychiatric (1\%) problems related to use. Furthermore, of those who reported being diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, the majority reported improvements in symptoms following 5-{MeO}-{DMT} use, including improvements related to post-traumatic stress disorder (79\%), depression (77\%), anxiety (69\%), and alcoholism (66\%) or drug use disorder (60\%).
Conclusion: Findings suggest that 5-{MeO}-{DMT} is used infrequently, predominantly for spiritual exploration, has low potential for addiction, and might have psychotherapeutic effects. Future research should examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of 5-{MeO}-{DMT} administration in humans using rigorous experimental designs.},

	abstract = {Background: A recent epidemiological study suggested that 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-{MeO}-{DMT}) used for spiritual and recreational reasons is associated with subjective improvement in depression and anxiety. Further exploration of the potential psychotherapeutic effects of 5-{MeO}-{DMT} could inform future clinical trials. Objectives: We examined self-reported improvement in depression and anxiety among people who use 5-{MeO}-{DMT} in a group setting with structured procedures guiding dose and administration of 5-{MeO}-{DMT}. Such procedures also include activities for the preparation of, and support during/following sessions, which are similar to procedures used in clinical trials of hallucinogen administration. Next, we examined whether depression or anxiety were improved following use, and whether the acute subjective effects (mystical/challenging) or beliefs about the 5-{MeO}-{DMT} experience were associated with improvements in these conditions. Methods: Respondents (n = 362; Mage = 47.7; Male = 55\%; White/ Caucasian = 84\%) completed an anonymous web-based survey. Results: Of those reporting having been diagnosed with depression (41\%) or anxiety (48\%), most reported these conditions were improved (depression = 80\%; anxiety = 79\%) following 5-{MeO}-{DMT} use, and fewer reported they were unchanged (depression = 17\%; anxiety = 19\%) or worsened (depression = 3\%; anxiety = 2\%). Improvement in depression/anxiety conditions were associated with greater intensity of mystical experiences and higher ratings of the spiritual significance and personal meaning of the 5-{MeODMT} experience. There were no associations between depression or anxiety improvement and the intensity of acute challenging physical/psychological effects during the 5-{MeO}-{DMT} experience. Conclusions: Future prospective controlled clinical pharmacology studies should examine the safety and efficacy of 5-{MeO}-{DMT} administration for relieving depression and anxiety.},

	abstract = {Knowledge Discovery in Databases ({KDD}) is an active and important research area with the promise for a high payoff in many business and scientiﬁc applications. One of the main tasks in {KDD} is classiﬁcation. A particular efﬁcient method for classiﬁcation is decision tree induction. The selection of the attribute used at each node of the tree to split the data (split criterion) is crucial in order to correctly classify objects. Different split criteria were proposed in the literature (Information Gain, Gini Index, etc.). It is not obvious which of them will produce the best decision tree for a given data set. A large amount of empirical tests were conducted in order to answer this question. No conclusive results were found. In this paper we introduce a formal methodology, which allows us to compare multiple split criteria. This permits us to present fundamental insights into the decision process. Furthermore, we are able to present a formal description of how to select between split criteria for a given data set. As an illustration we apply the methodology to two widely used split criteria: Gini Index and Information Gain.},

The larger resistance component, shown to be/oca/ised in the stratum corneum, varied markedly with the current intensity, the intensity of a previous pulse and the interval between the pulses, This component decreased with time and the decrease was dependent on the amount of electlical charge transferred through the skin. When constantvoltage pulses were used, the decrease could be equated to a process that reinforces itself. The smaller resistance component showed only relatively small variations with the different stimulus properties previously mentioned. It was concluded that the current intensity of transcutaneous electrical stimulation can only be controlled satisfactorily when currentregulated stimuli are used.},
